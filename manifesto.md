Through our own journey of building software and helping others to achieve the same goal, we have concluded that the following 4 principles should lie at the core of the Developer Experience:

- **Automate** the repetitive tasks
- **Conventionalise** the workflow through tooling
- **Sustain** the development pace consistently
- **Adopt** the industry wide best practices

We do not deny the value of other principles, however, we have come to value the above mentioned points with a significantly stronger emphasis.
